1️⃣ QIS Fest Management & Registration Portal

A dedicated QIS Fest Website will digitalize the entire fest management process. Students and participants from other colleges can register for events, track their participation status, view event schedules, download certificates, and receive notifications—all in one place. The portal will also display event details, circulars, rules, prize information, and faculty coordinators. This system reduces manual work, improves transparency, and provides a modern and efficient experience during college fests.

## 2️⃣ QIS AI Assistant (Chatbot Trained on QIS Data)

We will build QIS AI, an intelligent chatbot trained exclusively on QIS College’s data—academic schedules, departments, exams, transport, placements, hostels, and general campus information. Students can instantly ask questions like “When is the next exam?”, “Share the timetable”, or “Tell me about QIS College”. The chatbot acts as a 24×7 virtual helpdesk for students, parents, and visitors, reducing administrative load and providing quick, accurate responses. This positions QIS as a technologically forward and student-friendly campus.

## 3️⃣ QIS Hackathon & Project Expo

A QIS-wide Hackathon will be conducted to encourage innovation and hands-on learning among students. Teams from all departments will register, choose themes or problem statements, and build creative technology solutions within a fixed timeframe. After development, their projects will be showcased in a Project Expo, allowing them to present their work to faculty, management, and industry experts. This platform promotes teamwork, creativity, technical exposure, and real-world problem-solving skills.
