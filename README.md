# QIS-Ideas
## 1️⃣ QIS Fest Management & Registration Portal

A dedicated QIS Fest Website will digitalize the entire fest management process. Students and participants from other colleges can register for events, track their participation status, view event schedules, download certificates, and receive notifications—all in one place. The portal will also display event details, circulars, rules, prize information, and faculty coordinators. This system reduces manual work, improves transparency, and provides a modern and efficient experience during college fests.

## 2️⃣ QIS AI Assistant (Chatbot Trained on QIS Data)

We will build QIS AI, an intelligent chatbot trained exclusively on QIS College’s data—academic schedules, departments, exams, transport, placements, hostels, and general campus information. Students can instantly ask questions like “When is the next exam?”, “Share the timetable”, or “Tell me about QIS College”. The chatbot acts as a 24×7 virtual helpdesk for students, parents, and visitors, reducing administrative load and providing quick, accurate responses. This positions QIS as a technologically forward and student-friendly campus.

## 3️⃣ QIS Hackathon & Project Expo

A QIS-wide Hackathon will be conducted to encourage innovation and hands-on learning among students. Teams from all departments will register, choose themes or problem statements, and build creative technology solutions within a fixed timeframe. After development, their projects will be showcased in a Project Expo, allowing them to present their work to faculty, management, and industry experts. This platform promotes teamwork, creativity, technical exposure, and real-world problem-solving skills.

## 4️⃣ QIS Coding Excellence Program & QIS College Website

We will launch a Coding Excellence Program where the top-performing 10–15 students are selected and given hands-on, real-time training in modern web technologies. Under guided mentorship, these students will work on building a fully functional, high-quality QIS Coillege Website — a central platform that highlights the college’s achievements, monthly activities, student success stories, department updates, events, and ongoing initiatives. This website will be continuously updated by the team, allowing them to gain real project experience while showcasing QIS’s growth and academic excellence. The program not only develops strong technical talent but also builds a proud digital identity for QIS College.

## 5️⃣ QIS Coding Hour Program & Live Development Hall

We will establish a weekly Coding Hour Program hosted in a dedicated hall on campus where students can work together, practice coding, and actively contribute to the digital projects being built for QIS. This space will serve as a live development room, showcasing real-time work done by students—such as websites, dashboards, and tools developed under mentorship. When new parents, management, or potential admissions visit, this hall will demonstrate QIS’s strong technical culture and active learning environment. It becomes a visible proof of student talent, innovation, and hands-on development, significantly enhancing the college’s reputation and attracting higher admissions.

## 6️⃣ QIS Starter Coding Bootcamp (Beginner to Basics Program)

We will conduct a structured Starter Coding Bootcamp for freshers and non-programmers, focusing on fundamentals like HTML, CSS, Python basics, logical thinking, and hands-on practice. This foundation will help students who enter college with zero coding background build confidence within weeks. The bootcamp will run during weekends or evenings and will be designed to make every student industry-ready from their 1st year itself.


## 8️⃣ QIS GitHub Club (Version Control & Open-Source Culture)

We will start a GitHub Club where students learn how to use Git, GitHub, pull requests, issues, and team collaboration. This helps students understand how real companies work and allows them to build portfolios with meaningful code contributions. By graduation, every student will have their own GitHub profile filled with projects.

## 9️⃣ QIS Mini Projects Program (One Small Project Every Semester)

A program where students create one small project every semester, such as calculators, portfolio sites, mini games, dashboards, or simple apps. These projects build confidence, improve creativity, and help students create a strong resume. By final year, students will have 6–8 projects to showcase in interviews.

## 🔟 Student Tech Leadership Council (STLC)

We will form a Student Tech Leadership Council, selecting passionate students to lead coding clubs, manage hackathons, maintain college websites, and coordinate with faculty. This builds leadership, teamwork, communication, and responsibility. It also creates a strong tech community that keeps improving every year.



# 📌 How These Initiatives Will Help QIS College Management

All these proposed activities — coding programs, AI chatbot, hackathons, weekly coding hours, student-built websites, and project expos — are designed to transform QIS into a skill-driven, technology-centric campus, which directly benefits admissions, reputation, and placements.

## 1️⃣ Strong Advantage During New Admissions

Most engineering colleges in the Ongole region do not provide structured coding training, especially from 1st year.
By showcasing:

Dedicated Coding Hour Rooms

Live Development Hall where students build real projects

AI-driven tools built by QIS students

Monthly updates on the QIS Scholars Website

Parents and new students will immediately see a clear difference in how QIS prepares students for the future.
This becomes a powerful selling point during admissions meetings and campus tours.

## 2️⃣ Real Projects Built by QIS Students (Not Outsourced Work)

When a new student or parent sees:

Websites built by QIS students

Dashboards created during hackathons

Projects displayed in the Project Expo Hall

…it creates trust and excitement.

Instead of showing existing software or theoretical labs, the college can proudly showcase:
👉 “This is what our students built inside QIS.”

This becomes proof of:

Student capability

College mentorship

Active learning environment

## 3️⃣ Strong Placement Narrative for Interviews

Recruiters today ask students:

“What projects have you built?”
“What practical experience do you have?”

With this initiative, every student can say:

“I participated in QIS Hackathons”

“I contributed to the college website”

“I worked in the weekly coding hour room”

“I attended monthly tech workshops”

“I built a portfolio of 7–8 projects”

This shows practical exposure, not just marks.
It dramatically increases placement success.

## 4️⃣ Builds a Strong Tech Community Inside the College

Creating:

Coding clubs

GitHub communities

Mini projects program

Monthly workshops

Mentorship groups

…helps QIS build a self-sustaining tech culture where seniors guide juniors, and every year the talent grows stronger.

This long-term culture directly improves:

Student engagement

Retention

College reputation

Academic environment

## 5️⃣ Digital Identity & Brand Growth for QIS

The new initiatives create a strong digital presence:

QIS Fest Website

QIS Scholars Website

QIS AI Chatbot

Social media updates of Hackathons & Expos

This positions QIS as a modern, future-ready engineering college.
Parents, alumni, companies, and new students will see QIS as a college that actually builds real skills, not just teaches theory.

## 6️⃣ Direct Help for Weak or Beginner Students

Many students come to college with zero programming knowledge.
These programs:

Starter Coding Bootcamp

Weekly Coding Hour

Mini Projects

Mentorship groups

…slowly transform them from beginners to employable graduates.
This reduces backlog issues, improves academic performance, and creates confidence.

## 7️⃣ Long-Term Reputation and Admissions Growth

When QIS consistently shows:

Student-built projects

Innovation

Visible coding culture

Successful placements

…it automatically attracts:

More admissions

Better companies

Strong alumni relationships

Increased academic quality

This is how the college builds a modern engineering identity, grows reputation, and becomes the preferred choice for students and parents.
